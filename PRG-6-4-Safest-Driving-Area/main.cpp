//  Write a program that determines which of the five geographic regions within a major city
//  (north, south, east, west, and central) had the fewest reported automobile accidents last
//  year. It should have the following two functions, which are called by main:
//  int getNumAccidents() is passed the name of a region. It asks the user for the
//  number of automobile accidents reported in that region during the last year, validates
//  the input, then returns it. It should be called once for each city region.
//  void findLowest() is passed the five accident totals. It determines which is the
//  smallest and prints the name of the region, along with its accident figure.
//
//  Input validation: Do not accept an accident number that is less than 0
